This repo includes my testing code for the application of neural networks and other supervised learning
approaches to classify fault states in a simulated chemical process problem - the Tennessee Eastman process.

The data was featherized (https://github.com/wesm/feather) to import it into Python for use with
sci-kit learn's MLP Classifier.
